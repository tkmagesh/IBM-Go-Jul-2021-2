Golang
    Why?
    What is unique about Go?
        fast
        concurrency
        garbage collection

        compiled
        No VM (close to hardware)
        Memory management is taken care (by the garbage collector)

    Simplicity
        - No classes
        - No inheritance (ONLY composition)
        - No access modifiers
        - No exceptions (ONLY errors)

        - 25 keywords
            var, func, import, package, if, switch, for, fallthrough, continue, chan, go, select, range, make, new

    Built for concurrency
        - goroutines
        - 1000s of goroutines can be executed in one OS thread
        - scheduler is builtin in the runtime
        - language features for concurrency
            go, chan, select, range

    Close to hardware

    Modules & Packages

To run a program
    go run program.go
    
    OR

    go build program.go
    ./program

    OR

    go build -o myapp program.go
    ./myapp

Data Types
    bool
    string

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real float32, imaginary float32)
    complex128 (real float64, imaginary float64)

    byte (alias of uint8)
    rune (alias of int32) (represent an unicode character)
    

Go has support for higher order functions
    functions can be assigned to variables
    functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
    functions can be returned as return values from other functions

To create a module
    go mod init <module name>

    package is just a folder

To install a third party package
    go get github.com/fatih/color

    to use
    import "github.com/fatih/color"


Collections
    Array
        - Fixed size
    Slice
        - Dynamic size
        - Uses an array
